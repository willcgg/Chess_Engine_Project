## SUPERVISOR MEETING 13/01/2022 @10-10:45am

### Action Points:

- Focus on creating Poster for now
- Maybe implement some kind of interactivity to project to demonstrate in the presentation
- Keep meeting minutes and log notes of supervisor meetings

### Notes from meeting:

1. Discussed audience for presentation.
2. Discussed booking hour long meeting for in person to define marking criteria and other details.
3. Discussed Testing strategies, ie unit testing framework. Do some research into this for c# in visual studio. This will help me to visualize what actually needs to be done for each method abd speed up development by saving manually testing each feature.

> Tests will test:
> - board state - set board state
> - valid? - valid movements of pieces
> - en passant - test for en passant
> - castling - test that castling works correctly
> - in check?
> - checkmate?

4. Start properly bulking out tickets on trello board, class structure, testing
5. Discussed properly structuring repo, branches, classes e.t.c 
6. Discussed keeping more notes on project 
7. Come more prepared for next meeting; prep questions, whats my focus, whats blocking me, any clarification on anything and going in the right direction?
